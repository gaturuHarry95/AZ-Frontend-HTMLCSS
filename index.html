    <h1>My HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This is <b>my first HTML project</b>.I am demonstrating my understanding of 
        the basic structure of an HTML document, HTML tags and elements
         and text formatting in HTML. I am creating an 
        HTML file that incorporates these concepts and submitting it on GitHub</p>
    <p>In the next  <u>five years</u>,I aspire to master everything there is to know 
        to build a <i>modern responsive website</i> through using HTML together with other
        languages,tools and frameworks.
